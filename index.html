            <p class="paragraph1">Bernie and Angie are beautiful domestic tabby cats. 
                We adopted them in December of 2019 when they were 10 years old, and
                it has been an absolute joy to have them in our lives. Bernie is special
                needs (he gets separation anxiety, and he seems to have no sense of object
                permanence - when he can't see me, he panics then screams and cries for me).
                Angie has no special needs, but is a chonky girl because she'll eat Bernie's 
                food if he's not quick to eat. We love our sweet baby angels! </p>
